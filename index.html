                <p>Rachael is somewhat new to the development world. She's spent the previous few years managing different retail stores. However, her love of math and problem-solving paired with her desire to make a difference in the world, has lead her to make a career change into the software world. She is in the process of becoming a Full-Stack Developer through the UPENN LPS Coding Bootcamp with an anticipated graduation of July 2019.</p>
                <p>In her personal time, you will find Rachael listening to live music, spending time outdoors, or traveling. Being new to the Philadelphia area, she has really enjoyed exploring the city, especially the restaurant scene. She has a dog named Bruno who thinks he's a human, and a boyfriend, Bryan, who thinks he's a superhero. To keep herself sane, she reguarly spends time eating chocolate and watching "The Office".</p>
